A challenge from Frontend Mentor - A responsive QR code page 

This is an exercise from Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H).

The goal was to build a QR code page looking as close as I could from the image and work thinking in a responsive way

I also got to practice centering divs and elements.
